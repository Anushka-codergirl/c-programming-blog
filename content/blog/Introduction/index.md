Hello World! This is my first post on my new C Programming blog! How exciting!

## C Programming Language

- It is general purpose, compiled, structural and middle level programming language.
- It was developed at _AT & T's Bell Laboratories_ of USA in 1972.
- It was designed by [Dennis M. Ritchie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Ritchie).

### Why use C?

- the portability of the compilers.
- the standard library concept.
- a powerful and varied repertoire of operation.
- an elegant syntax.
- ready access to the hardware when needed.
- and the ease with which applications can be optimized by hand coding isolated procedures.

### Features of C:-

- It is reliable, simple and easy to use.
- It has the virtues of a high-level programming language with the efficiency of an assembly language.
- It supports user-defined data types for greater flexibity in programming.
- It supports modular and structured programming concepts, i.e. C program may be broken into smaller tasks or unit.
- It supports a rich library of functions that programmers can use directly to code their applications efficiently.
- It provides low-level memory and device access features, making it suitable for writing system programs.
- Good base for learning C++, C# or Java.
- It offers better interaction with hardware.
