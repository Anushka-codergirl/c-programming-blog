### Pointers

A pointer is a variable that holds a memory address, usually the location of another variable in memory.

### NULL Pointers

It is a good practice to always assign a NULL value to a pointer variable in case we don't have exact address to be assigned. A pointer that is assigned NULL is called a null pointer. NULL pointer is a constant with a value of 0 defined in several standard libraries.
