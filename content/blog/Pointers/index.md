### Pointers

A pointer is a variable that holds a memory address, usually the location of another variable in memory.

### Types of Pointers

1. NULL Pointers
2. Void Pointers
3. Wild Pointers
4. Dangling Pointers

#### NULL Pointers

It is a good practice to always assign a NULL value to a pointer variable in case we don't have exact address to be assigned. A pointer that is assigned NULL is called a null pointer. NULL pointer is a constant with a value of 0 defined in several standard libraries.

#### Void Pointers

It is also known as a general-purpose pointer.

#### Wild Pointers

Pointers that are not initialized are called wild pointers.

#### Dangling Pointers

A pointer that points to a memory location that has been deleted is called a dangling pointer.
