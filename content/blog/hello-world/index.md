This is my second post on my new C Programming blog!

Oh, and here's a great quote from this AZ Quotes on
[Programming](https://www.azquotes.com/quote/803730).

> “It’s harder to read code than to write it.” — Joel Spolsky

### First C Program - Hello World

```
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
printf("Hello World!");
return 0;
}
```
