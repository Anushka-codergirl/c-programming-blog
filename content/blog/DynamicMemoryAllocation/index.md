###Dynamic Memory Allocation

There are four types of functions for dynamic memory allocation: -

| SL.No. | Function  | Description                                                                                  |
| ------ | --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1.     | malloc()  | allocates requested size of bytes and returns a pointer first byte of allocated space.       |
| 2.     | calloc()  | allocates space for an array elements initializes to 0 and then returns a pointer to memory. |
| 3.     | realloc() | changes the size of previously allocated space.                                              |
| 4.     | free()    | deallocate the previously allocated space.                                                   |
