### Function

A **function** is a named unit of a group of program statements that can be invoked from other parts of the program as and when required.

**Function Prototype** : A function prototype is a declaration of the function that tells the program about the type of the value returned by the function and the number and type of each argument.

#### Types of function

#### Call by value

In call by value, the called function creates its own copies of original values sent to it. Any changes, that are made, occur on the function's copy of values and are not reflected back to the calling function.

#### Call by reference

In call by reference, the called function accesses and works with the original values using their references. Any changes, that occur, take place on the original values and are reflected back to the calling function.
