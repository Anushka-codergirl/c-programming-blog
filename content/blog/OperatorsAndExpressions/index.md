**Operators and Operands**
The operations (specific tasks) are represented by Operators and the objects of the operation(s) are referred to as Operand.

**Expression**
An expression in C is any valid combination of tokens.

### Precedence of operators

The precedence of operators determines which operator is executed first if there is more than one operator in an expression.

### Associativity of Operators

The associativity of operators determines the direction in which an expression is evaluated.
