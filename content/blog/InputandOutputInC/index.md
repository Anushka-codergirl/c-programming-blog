## Input and Output Functions

### 1. Formated I/O Functions

These functions allow us to supply the input in a fixed format and let us obtain the output in the specified form. There are several format specifiers and escape sequences available to format input and output.
The functions **printf()**, and **scanf()** fall under this category.

### 2. Unformatted I/O Functions

These functions work faster since they do not have the overheads of formatting the input or output.
