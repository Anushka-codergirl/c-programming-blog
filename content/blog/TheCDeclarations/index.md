### The C Declarations

####Character set

A character set is a set of valid characters that a language can recognise.
C has the following character set:

- _Letters_ A-Z ,a-z
- _Digits_ 0-9
- _Special Symbols_ + - \\* / % () []{}\ / = !<> . , ; : & ^ ? \\_ ' " ~ # \$
- _White Spaces_ Blank Space, Horizontal tab, Carriage return, Newline, Form feed.

**Token**: It is the smallest individual unit in a program.

**Keywords**: These are the preserved words that convey a special meaning to the language compiler. It cannot be used as variable names because that would try to change the existing meaning of the keyword, that is'nt allowed.

**Identifier** : It is the name given by user for a unit of the program i.e. variables, constants, functions and user-define data.

####Rules for an Identifier

- An Identifier can only have alphanumeric characters(a-z , A-Z , 0-9) and underscore(\_).
- The first character of an identifier can only contain alphabet(a-z , A-Z) or underscore (\_).
- Identifiers are also case sensitive in C. For example name and Name are two different identifiers in C.
- Keywords are not allowed to be used as Identifiers.
- No special characters, such as semicolon, period, whitespaces, slash or comma are permitted to be used in or as Identifier.

**Literals**: These (often referred to as contants) are data items that never change their value during a program run.
