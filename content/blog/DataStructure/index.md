## Data Structure

It defines the way in which data can be stored and used efficiently.

These are classified in two categories:

1. **Linear Data Structures**: In this type data are processed one after another.
   Examples: Array, Linked List and Queue
2. **Non-Linear Data Structures**: In this type insertion and deletion is not possible in a linear fashion.
   Examples: Tree, Graph

####Abstract Data Type
It can be defined as a data type whose properties are specified independently of any particular implementation.
Example: When we declare a variable x of type int we know that x can store a number without decimal point in the range specified by the programming language and can be used in arithmetic and logical operations.
