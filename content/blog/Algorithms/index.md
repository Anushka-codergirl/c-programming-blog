##Algorithm
An algorithm is a sequence of steps to be carried out in order to solve a given problem.

###Characteristics of Algorithm:

It includes:

1. Input: An algorithm must work on externally provided one or more input.
2. Output: An algorithm must provide one or more output.
3. Finiteness: An algorithm must terminate after finite number of steps.
4. Definiteness: The steps of an algorithm must be definite without leading to multiple meanings.
5. Effectiveness: The steps of an algorithm must be effective so that it can be solved easily.

###Analysis of Algorithm
An algorithm can be analysed for its performance based on time and storage it needs. The time required by an algorithm is known as **time complexity** and the storage required by the algorithm is known as **space complexity**.

####Time Complexity
The total amount of computer time needed to complete the execution of an algorithm is called as time complexity.

####Space Complexity
The total amount of computer memory needed to complete the execution of an algorithm means a program is called space complexity. It includes fixed space like code, statement, instructions, constants and variables, like problem dependent variables, stacks.
